Making it difficult to build a foot-gun is a feature.\n\nBy being so widely used, it has also led to the development of many other projects on top of it, further expanding the ecosystem.",

By allowing listings in stables, sellers can fix a stable floor price; allowing listings in the underlying token, e.g., listings of veVELO for VELO, the seller creates a zero-slippage offer - if VELO's price moves, the price of veVELO necessarily follows as veVELO is VELO (albeit vote-escrowed). \n\nSince its launch, our NFT Market volume is several times the volume of all other NFT Markets on Optimism combined.

London hard fork also contained the EIP1559 implementation - change in the fee mechanism for Ethereum.\nI also had contributions to rust web3 library widely used for all rust projects on ethereum and EVM compatible chains and also contributed to Cowswap project which main impact is protecting users from MEV and giving best prices.",

Now the tool is being used by auditing firms, protocol designers, academics and searchers to model their systems and applications with speed, rigor, and EVM execution parity.

Additionally, the Twitter thread featuring Opclave gained over 600K views, contributing to the popularity of OP Stack\n\nThe Clave team proposed EIP-7212 to enable the use of the P256 curve. Following this, many individuals from the ecosystem began development on the P256 curve. The Ledger team further developed the work of Opclave. Extensive discussions took place on builder forums, and numerous tweets were posted on Twitter regarding EIP-7212",

This article prompted the entire ecosystem to examine the usage of secp256r1 in OP Stack. \n\nAt a time when there were very few projects utilizing OP Stack technology, Opclave emerged and led the way for other projects. After Opclave, many projects worked on Hardware Signing and produced products. \n\nAll of these have contributed to increasing the awareness of Optimism Collective among even more people.",

However, the state of current governance is very bad and we need new ways to approach governance. \n\nI needed almost 2 years to make this first pilot possible. I share all learnings and experiences with the collective so we can all learn from it and deploy improved versions in the future. ",

So well i guess my contribution might be more on a symbolic level, but in the beginning of 2023 when i thought a lot about which L2 to use i went for Optimism because at that time there was mainly the choice between Arbitrum, Optimism and the sort-of L2 Polygon PoS. Arbitrum seemed very DeFi focused, Optimism had at least a NFT marketplace even though with obviously little real use.\nAnd there is this NFT tool platform decent.xyz which supported Optimism. At that time more or less the only platform. It felt a bit lonely at that time with Optimism music NFTs, not many others existed.  Mint success was negligible, but well still fun.\nBecause it ofc is also somehow exciting to be an early user of something.\n",

Many Dapps often lack users.  Many wallets tbh have still poor Optimism support.\nI would want more users to apply, because they are in the end what the Optimism blockchain exists for.  And if there is a symbolic grant or not, isn't even the point.\nIt's nice that Optimism helped to save gas fees otherwise there wouldn't be any reason to use it, i think this is obvious.",
