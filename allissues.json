    "body": "**What is a Draft Project Idea?**\n\nA Draft Project Idea is a concept for a project within the Optimism ecosystem that is generally considered valuable but has not yet been fleshed out into a clearly defined product. Draft Project Ideas may be converted into Ecosystem Project Ideas as they are explored further and more thoroughly specified.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThe Impact Calculator is designed to streamline the evaluation of projects in the Optimism RetroPGF voting process by quantifying their impact through various metrics. This tool is expected to transition the grantmaking process from individual project evaluation to a more strategic overview, helping to maintain and improve the ROI of grant allocations.\nThe idea for this project is to built a simple prototype to test out the idea. \n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/assets/43515441/6bd16763-b586-466c-b4c1-41595af98411)\n\nYou can find a Figma mock up with some more detailed descriptions [here](https://www.figma.com/file/OS8DSbKyuiYPqcRTmmhTIM/Impact-Calculator-%F0%9F%8C%B1?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4qGwi0ZEsvOMlxkF-1) \n\nDive deeper into impact vectors by checking out Carl's post on [levels of the game](https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/HikrWg-CneYoHruCON5gCi6BL7R71TEBpdJjgqon9M8) and [Ecosystem Impact Vectors](https://mirror.xyz/cerv1.eth/qL9YKLN9-dBzM89qKaZYgHK2ccpZy2XLPz2Z1PObwCg), or play around with [OpenSource Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/).\n\nIf you're interesting in tackling this project idea, come [join this Telegram group\n](https://t.me/+B5likgTv8sk3MWVi)\n## Possible Features\n1. Impact Vector Selection: Allows users to choose from various impact vectors with descriptions and creator names, search functionality, and options to view detailed pages or add vectors to a ballot.\n2. Ballot View: A ballot system where users can select or deselect impact vectors and edit their configurations. This includes a graphical representation of the distribution of funds among projects.\n3. Detailed View: Each impact vector has a detailed view, including a name, description, creator, and a link to GitHub. Users can visualize the impact vector and configure it.\n4. Configuration Option: Users can set a scale or weight to deterimine how flat or skewed the eventual distribution of tokens to projects should be.",

    "body": "## Foundation Mission (RFP) â€“ Superchain Bridge RFP\r\n_To take on this project, submit a proposal to this thread by December 15. Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n* **S5 Intent**: Technical Decentralization\r\n* **Foundation Mission (RFP):** Host an open source user interface (UI) that allows users to move assets to/from Ethereum (L1) to any OP Chain (L2) in the Superhain (OP Mainnet, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode, etc.) via the [standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#) and OP Chain (L2) to OP Chain (L2) when interop is available.\r\n* **Proposal Tier:**  [Fledgling](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877) \r\n* **Baseline grant amount**: 200K OP\r\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple \r\n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor**: Zain (@zainbacchus)\r\n* **Submit by**: December 15th at 19:00 GMT\r\n* **Selection by**: December 29th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) will help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\nThis RFP introduces a Superchain Bridge interface which acts as the foundation for users to move tokens to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain using the canonical standard bridge in the OP Stack.\r\n\r\nOptimism is leaning on its ecosystem to bootstrap access to the protocol. Not running our own frontend increases censorship resistance and decentralization, but also helps us bootstrap a distributed ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAs such, this mission will contribute to a more resilient bridging ecosystem for the Superchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface allows users to bridge to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain from L1 Ethereum using the [standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#). Once the [MVP of low latency L2 to L2 message passing](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/understand/explainer/#low-latency-l2-to-l2-message-passing) is live (est. mid 2024), the Superchain Bridge interface should also allow users to bridge between OP Chains.\r\n\r\nCompleting this RFP requires building an open source frontend that allows users to bridge to / from any OP Chain in the Superchain. The frontend should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. This RFP requires both designs and implementation.\r\n \r\nFor this RFP, the Optimism Foundation will accept up to two submissions. Multiple frontends will maximize the likelihood of success and improve the resilience of the system.\r\n\r\nThe target grant reward for each submission will be 200k OP. Teams should discuss the solution criteria below with the Foundation, and may arrive at a different mutually agreeable grant amount dependent on the scope of their work.\r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the Superchain Bridge interface:\r\n\r\n**Wallet connection**\r\n- As a user I can use either an EOA or Smart Contract Wallet to deposit / withdraw from the bridge interface. The wallet connect should include but not limited to support browser injected wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, as well as WalletConnect v2 and smart contract wallets.\r\n\r\n**Token bridges**\r\n- As a user I can bridge from L1 to L2 Mainnets / Testnets for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can bridge from L2 to L2 Mainnets / Testnets for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can specify the destination address I want to transfer tokens to\r\n\r\n**Token lists**\r\n- As a user I can use my preferred token list to find which tokens I want to bridge. The token lists should include but should not be limited to the [Superchain Tokenlist](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#the-superchain-token-list). \r\n- As a user I can bridge any arbitrary [standard ERC-20](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#depositing-erc20s) using the bridge interface\r\n\r\n**3rd party bridges**\r\n- As a user I can find a list of supported 3rd party bridges when bridging to/from a non-Ethereum / OP Chain blockchain\r\n\r\n**Account history**\r\n- As a user I can view my deposits / withdrawals for any OP Chain in the Superchain (e.g. OP, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode etc.)\r\n- As a user I can initiate the two-step withdrawal process for any relevant withdraws\r\n\r\n**Query parameters** \r\n- As a user I can create a link that points to a specific network on the bridge (e.g. bridge.org/base)\r\n- As a user I can create a link that points to a specific token on a specific network on the bridge (e.g. bridge.org/base/USDC).\r\n\r\n**Block explorer**\r\n- As a User I can select my preferred block explorer for viewing transaction confirmation. This should include but not limited to support OnceUpon, Blockscout, and Etherscan (when available).\r\n\r\n**i18n**\r\n- As a user I can select my preferred language to interact with the bridge interface including but not limited to English (EN), Hindi (HI), Arabic (AR), German (DE), Spanish (ES), French (FS), Indonesian (ID), Japanese (JA), Vietnamese (VI), Chinese Simplified (ZH-CN), Chinese Traditional (ZH-TW), Korean (KO), Polish (PL), Portuguese (PT), and Thai (TH)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compliance**\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface should include an appropriate user legal agreement and risk disclosures, which will be subject to evaluation and confirmation by the Foundation.  The Superchain Bridge Interface should also implement appropriate compliance measures to prevent it from being used in violation of applicable laws. The compliance measures implemented by a grantee will be subject to evaluation and confirmation by the Foundation. Prior agreed compliance costs incurred by the grantee will be reimbursed by the Foundation for at least one year following launch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Superchain Registry**\r\nThe Superchain Bridge Interface should only include OP Chains in the Superchain and update to include new OP Chains as they come online. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe user interface must use the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/tree/main/superchain/configs/mainnet) and relevant [CCTP bridges](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoin/docs/cctp-protocol-contract) to determine the canonical bridges that are supported. Furthermore, the UI should provide instructions for how the user can verify using their wallet that they are interacting with the canonical bridge for the respective OP Chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Service level agreement**\r\nThe bridge interface should continue to support adding new OP Chains as they come online. To ensure this happen, the RFP proposer must agree to a service level agreement that governs the ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancement of the Bridge UI, including but not limited to the addition of new operation chains, bug fixes, updates, and improvements as outlined in the RFP.

Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n* **S5 Intent**: Grow the Superchain\r\n* **Foundation Mission (RFP):** Host an open source user interface (UI) that allows users to access Safe deployments on any OP Chain (L2) in the Superchain (OP Mainnet, Base, PGN, Zora, Mode, etc.)\r\n* **Baseline grant amount**: 150k OP\r\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** Multiple \r\n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor**: Zain (@zainbacchus)\r\n* **Submit by**: Dec 4th at 19:00 GMT\r\n* **Selection by**: Dec 8th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) will help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\nA common pain point for developers on OP Chains as well as Chain operators themselves is not having the Safe functionality. This RFP aims to remedy this by expanding access to the Safe functionality and interface to all OP Chains thereby reducing developer and operator friction. \r\n\r\nThe scope of this RFP will be to introduce a Superchain [Safe interface](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web) which acts as the foundation for users to use the [Safe functionality](https://github.com/safe-global) across all testnets and mainnets  in the Superchain\r\n\r\nAs such, this mission will contribute to a more resilient and secure developer ecosystem for the Superchain.\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nThe deployment (if required) of Safe Contracts (ex Gnosis Safe) and backend services for all mainnet and testnet OP Chains in the Superchain, and supporting Superchain Safe interface. \r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the Superchain Safe RFP include deployment (if required), backend services configuration (if required), Superchain Safe UI, and ongoing maintenance. \r\n\r\n**1. Deployment and configuration**: deploy Safe contracts (if required), and configure the latest Safe components on adequate infrastructure for 2 environments (Stage and Production)\r\n\r\n- Safe Contract deployments: As part of the RFP, we expect deterministic deployment of the collection of Safe contracts (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts) on the following OP Chain mainnets and testnets: Zora, Public Goods Network, Mode, Lyra, Orderly, and Ancient8 as well as any future OP Stack Chain (total of 10 deployments). With the launch of the SafeL2 as a predeploy at 0x914d7Fec6aaC8cd542e72Bca78B30650d45643d7 in the OP Stack estimated to launch Q1 2024, as new chains come online no deployment of Safe contracts will be needed. \r\n\r\n- Safe Backend Components: For all chains, we expect the deployment and configuration of Safe Backend Components (as outlined in https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts), as well as any respective frontend updates and maintenance as needed\r\n\r\n**2. Superchain Safe UI:** Design, configuration and implementation of an open-sourced Superchain specific Safe UI using the [default Safe web interface](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-wallet-web) that supports all OP Chain testnet and mainnets. DNS to be owned by Optimism. \r\n\r\n**3. Maintenance:** perform regular Safe updates, infrastructure monitoring & optimization, new features enablement (according to requests from OP Labs or Optimism Foundation). See service level agreement below. \r\n\r\n**4. Additional considerations:** \r\n\r\n- Initial setup maintenance: We will reimburse the infrastructure cost for 10 OP Stack Chains (incl. 2 staging environments each) for 1 year (capped at $30k)\r\n\r\n- Superchain Registry: the Superchain Safe Interface should only include OP Chains in the Superchain â€“ referring to the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/tree/main/superchain/configs/mainnet) to determine the canonical chains that are supported.\r\n\r\n- Service level agreement: the Superchain Safe interface should continue to support adding new OP Chains as they come online. To ensure this happen, the RFP proposer must agree to a service level agreement that governs the ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancement of the Superchain Safe UI, including but not limited to the addition of new operation chains, bug fixes, updates, and improvements as outlined in the RFP. Past the 1 year service agreement, through Optimismâ€™s Retroactive Public Goods Funding, we expect interface maintainers will be rewarded based on the reliability of the interface. Expected Monthly Uptime 99% (i.e. ~7.31hrs of downtime / month)\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Foundation Mission (RFP)?** \r\n\r\nProgress can be measured based upon the completion of the following milestones:\r\n\r\n- Specification for implementation, design approach, and architecture for the functionality listed above.\r\n- Open-source code repository to observe progress over time\r\n- Successful deployment and configuration of Safe contracts and services for at least 10 OP Chains within the scope of this RFP\r\n- 1 year toll gate: Service level agreement for interface has been hit \r\n\r\n**How should RetroPGF badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Number of OP Chains successfully integrated with the Superchain Safe UI\r\n- Number of OP Stack Chains with Safe contracts deployed within the scope of this RFP\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Application instructions\r\n\r\n_To apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread below.

    "body": "## Foundation Mission (RFP) â€“ Proof of attendance testnet faucet \r\n_To take on this project, submit a proposal to this thread by December 8. Read more about Missions [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)._\r\n\r\n* **S5 Intent**: Grow the Superchain\r\n* **Foundation Mission (RFP):** Build a way for hackathon participants to claim larger testnet funds from in person hackathons via the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet)\r\n* **Proposal Tier:**  [Ember](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877) \r\n* **Baseline grant amount**: 30K OP\r\n* **Accepting one or multiple proposals:** One \r\n* **OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor**: Zain (@zainbacchus)\r\n* **Submit by**: December 8th at 19:00 GMT\r\n* **Selection by**: December 15th at 19:00 GMT\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission (RFP) will help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\n[Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) is a developer tool that allows developers to get free testnet ETH to test and build apps on testnet OP Chains like Base Sepolia, OP Sepolia, PGN Sepolia, Zora Sepolia, and other OP Chains in the Superchain. \r\n\r\nDevelopers who have an Optimist NFT, Gitcoin Passport attestation, or WorldID are able to get larger drips from the faucet. \r\n\r\nA common pain point for hackathon participants is not having credentials yet for larger drips. This RFP aims to expand access to larger testnet fund drips to participants at in person hackathons and reduce developer friction when building on OP Chains. \r\n\r\nAs such, this mission will contribute to a more resilient developer ecosystem for the Superchain.\r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nCompleting this RFP requires building an open source frontend that allows users to claim a proof of attendance attestation, mint an Optimist NFT, and get larger testnet fund drips. The interface should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. This RFP requires both designs and implementation.\r\n, \r\nFor this RFP, the Optimism Foundation will accept one submission.\r\n\r\nThe target grant reward for the submission will be 30K OP. Teams should discuss the solution criteria below with the Foundation, and may arrive at a different mutually agreeable grant amount dependent on the scope of their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Solution Criteria:**\r\n\r\nCore functionality of the claim experience includes both a flow for event maintainers and an end user flow. \r\n\r\n**Proposed maintainer flow**\r\nTo set up the claim experience, the event maintainer should require minimal setup.\r\n- Maintainer sets up a new event using an admin portal\r\n- Maintainer is provided a URL to use for the specific in person events\r\n- Maintainer sets up the URL at the respective event\r\n\r\n**Proposed end user flow**\r\nTo claim the proof of attendance attestation the flow should be sybil-resistant, gasless, and allows the user to specify their preferred address. \r\n- Developers come to the OP booth \r\n- Developer scans the QR code or URL at the OP booth\r\n- Developer completes challenge that proves theyâ€™re at the booth (eg by entering a unique code)\r\n- Developer enters their wallet address or ENS name\r\n- Developer gets a proof of attendance attestation and Optimist NFT minted to their specified address \r\n- Developer is prompted use the faucet to get larger drips from the faucet or customize their Optimist NFT\r\n\r\n**Ethereum attestation service (EAS) and Optimist NFT**\r\n[EAS](https://docs.optimism.io/identity/contracts-eas) is an open-source public good that is included as a predeploy in the OP Stack. The proof of attendance attestations should use the EAS contracts on OP Mainnet and requires a new schema for the proof of attendance attestations to be created. \r\n\r\n[The Optimist NFT](https://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft) is a fully customizable digital avatar that allows you to showcase your personality and build your onchain identity. \r\n\r\n\r\nProposed implementation of proof of attestation / auto-minting the Optimist NFT:\r\n- Create an [EAS resolver](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/resolver-contracts) that restricts ability to create this attestation to specific addresses\r\n- This resolver should maintain a mapping(address => bool) of everyone who currently has this attestation using the onAttest and onRevoke hooks\r\n- Update [OptimistAllowlist](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/periphery/op-nft/OptimistAllowlist.sol).sol to check the resolver contract to see if user is eligible\r\n- Auto-mint feature: Automatically mint the Optimist NFT to users who have the proof of attendance attestation\r\n  - Option 1: The resolver should do the above, then directly mint the NFT\r\n  - Option 2: Use multicall3 to 1. Create the attestation, 2.

    "body": "## FoundationÂ Mission Request - Season 5 GovNERD(s)\r\n\r\n**Foundation Mission Summary:**Â govNERDs improve governance accessibility by shepherding proposals through the feedback, approval, and voting process. This will be especially important in Season 5 as we run new processes (Delegate Mission Requests) and bring Citizensâ€™ House governance online. **We plan to transition the govNERDs to an open contribution path before Season 6 begins.** \r\n\r\n**S5Â [Intent](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874):**Â Governance accessibility\r\n\r\n**ProposalÂ [Tier](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877):**Â Ember\r\n\r\n**Baseline grant amount:**Â 13,500 OP per GovNERD\r\n\r\n**Should this Foundation Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:**Â Up to 3; 1 govNERD will be dedicated to Citizensâ€™ House. Additional govNERDs may be added throughout the Season as needed, these govNERDs would receive a pro-rata portion of the grant for the portion of the Season they are active. \r\n\r\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Sponsor:**Â @op_lavande\r\n\r\n**Submit by:**Â December 1st at 23:59 GMT\r\n\r\n**Selection by:**Â December 6th at 23:59 GMT\r\n\r\n**Start date:**Â December 7th \r\n\r\n**Completion date:**Â May 8th (tentative end of Season 5) \r\n\r\n**Foundation Point of Contact:**Â @op_lavande andÂ @Nicca42\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Mission Request\r\n\r\n### **How will this Foundation Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?**\r\n\r\nThe iterative nature of Optimism governance means it is constantly changing. While this should ultimately lead to improvements in the health of the overall governance system, it makes the system harder to navigate and has lowered accessibility of Optimism governance. govNERDs help shepherd proposals through the feedback, approval, and voting process while ensuring the forum is a place for the highest quality engagement. This improves governance accessibility by making it easier for proposers to effectively navigate the proposal process and for voters to find the high quality proposals that require their attention in both Houses. \r\n\r\nThis Season, we will add an additional govNERD focused on supporting RetroPGF rounds. \r\n\r\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission Request?**\r\n\r\ngovNERDs will serve as neutral shepherds that ensure high quality governance proposals move through the proposal process successfully, taking over some important administrative work the Optimism Foundation has thus far fulfilled.\r\n\r\n***General Governance Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure voters understand relevant processes during Season 5, clarifying any ambiguities in documentation\r\n- Attend governance community calls to identify and clarify areas of confusion about Season 5\r\n- Maintain the public governance calendar during Season 5, updating and circulating as needed\r\n- Maintain the Token House and Citizenâ€™s House Onboarding Hubs\r\n\r\n***Proposal Feedback Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure all Season 5 proposals follow templates, gathering feedback on templates and suggesting improvements to the Optimism Foundation. This is especially important for Delegate Mission Requests.\r\n- Address any inconsistencies or non-compliance in proposals\r\n- Identify where there is overlap in proposals and help proposers reduce overlap or collaborate\r\n- Facilitate timely feedback from voters on high quality proposals\r\n\r\n***Proposal Approval Process:***\r\n\r\n- Facilitate the review of proposals that require approvals by voters in advance of the deadline required to move to a vote\r\n- Aid the Foundation in implementing any processes aimed at making the Mission Request approval process easier\r\n\r\n***Proposal Voting Process:***\r\n\r\n- Alert voters to the start and end of Special Voting Cycles and any other deadlines during the Reflection Period\r\n- Manage Voting Cycle Roundups, adding approved proposals to the roundup before the deadline\r\n- Draft copy for votes, to be reviewed and approved by the Foundation\r\n- Ensure voters understand what they need to be voting on throughout Season 5\r\n\r\n***Proposal Veto Process:***\r\n\r\n- Ensure voters are aware of any veto windows, and that they understand how to veto and what a veto means, throughout Season 5 (this pertains to Citizensâ€™ House in Season 5)\r\n\r\n***Forum Management:***\r\n\r\n- Monitor, manage, and reduce low quality forum engagement during Season 5\r\n- Manage discourse tags to aid discoverability of relevant proposals during Season 5\r\n- Flag important posts and/or comments to the Optimism Foundation\r\n- Aid the Foundation in posting future Reflection Period posts to the forum\r\n- Assist with on-chain analytics reports (more details to be published soon)\r\n\r\nThis Season, we will add an additional govNERD focused on supporting RetroPGF rounds. This govNERD will: \r\n\r\n- Support RetroPGF applicants throughout the process of a round\r\n- Ensure applicants are aware that a round is taking place\r\n- Support applicants in tracking their impact\r\n- Answer questions relating to the application process\r\n- Support third party RetroPGF tooling such asÂ [RetroPGFhub](https://retropgfhub.com/)Â andÂ [RetroLists](https://retrolist.app/)\r\n\r\n#### The exact scope of govNERDs may evolve over the course of the Season\r\n\r\n### **How should the Foundation measure progress towards this Mission?**\r\n\r\n- If this Mission is successful, the Foundation should be able to remove its role in the following functions:\r\n    - Maintenance of the public governance calendar during Season 5\r\n    - Procedural questions raised in governance community calls\r\n    - Announcements to voters pertaining to voting cycles or general governance schedules (without a corresponding decrease in turnout per proposal)\r\n    - Alerts related to proposals receiving enough approvals to move to a vote, when required\r\n    - Publication of Voting Cycle Roundups\r\n    - Reduction in forum spam, as measured by the number of forum issues the Foundation is asked to address\r\n    - Applicant support during retroPGF rounds \r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?**\r\n\r\n- The Foundation may attest to the reduction in workload as a result of govNERDs taking on work for which the Foundation used to be responsible\r\n- The Foundation will document any positive or negative feedback from delegates and Citizens interacting with govNERDs throughout the Reflection Period and share a summary\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Application Instructions:**\r\n\r\nTo apply for this Mission Request, please complete the form below and submit as a comment on this issue thread.

While grants from Optimism Governance are effective in aligning builders with Optimismâ€™s long-term success, builders sometimes need capital in order to cover up-front development and growth costs. \r\n\r\nTo complete this Mission, the Collective is looking for someone to establish an Optimism Ecosystem Investment Network that connects builders and investors. This project should:\r\n- Aggregate a cohort of investors interested in connecting with builders on OP Mainnet and understand their investment thesis\r\n- Establish a scalable process for aggregating and collating the flow: process to source leads from all relevant avenues, clear application instructions for projects, simple yet informative application template, and reliable pattern to share project details with investor groups\r\n- Facilitate introductions between builders and investors where and when appropriate \r\n- Gather feedback from investors and builders on the process and identify ways to improve the program\r\n\r\nThis Mission does not include the following: \r\n- Advice or participation in structuring deal terms between investors and builders.\r\n- Making investment recommendations or providing financial advice. \r\n \r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nVenture investment plays an important role in the long-term vision for Optimism. Today, Optimism runs regular rounds of Retroactive Public Goods Funding to builders contributing to the public good of the Optimism Collective. Eventually, venture investment can be an important part of this funding mechanism: RetroPGF can create a market of investable projects by providing an \"exit\" in the form of funding from RPGF rounds. This allows venture investors to invest in exchange for equity or for future funding from RPGF, if received by the team. This helps make seed capital from venture investors more accessible to builders who need access to funding in order to start building. For more on this topic, read Vitalikâ€™s [guest post](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) on the Optimism blog. \r\n\r\nThis is not required for this Mission Request or for the Ecosystem Investment Network. It is included here as context to help influence how this project could evolve over time. \r\n\r\n### **What milestones will help the Collective track progress towards completion of this Foundation Mission Request (RFP)?**\r\n\r\n- Clear project plan with milestones and projected dates for completion of each milestone.\r\n- Published process to source leads throughout the ecosystem \r\n- Published process for projects to participate in the network\r\n- Go-live date and launch for the first iteration of the program\r\n\r\n\r\n### **How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\r\n\r\nA successful Mission may be measured on: \r\n- number of projects and investment groups participating in the network\r\n- number of introductions of projects and investors\r\n\r\nBadgeholders may also identify more rigorous or quantitative metrics of success at their discretion as part of the retroPGF evaluation process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n## Application instructions\r\nTo apply for this RFP, please complete the form in the expandable section below and leave your response as a comment on this issue thread. Submissions will be open until October 3rd, at which time the Foundation will review all submissions and select one individual/team to complete the work defined here.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Submission form</summary>\r\n\r\n_Copy the entire application below and leave a comment on this issue with your answers completed.

    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nOptimism's Superchain vision is to create a network of blockchains that provides the UX like a single blockchain, with OPstack being the essential tool for creating that vision. An important piece that is missing in the toolbox is an open-source, easy-to-use explorer that allows anyone to spin up an explorer easily while providing better than etherscan UX for their end users. \r\n\r\nL2scan is multi-chain by default. This allows users to monitor and analyze txs, assets, and other vital data without switching platforms. The open-source version of L2scan will provide developers who want to build on opstack an out-of-box, easy-to-use explorer with low maintenance cost. (blockscout alternative) \r\n\r\nAlso, we want to provide the hosted version of L2scan as the AI-powered blockchain explorer to the Optimism ecosystem. It will be a combination of an AI analytics platform + dev tools + user portal + Search Engine with the following feature: \r\n\r\n### Possible Features\r\n-Cross-chain search engine\r\n-Account System\r\n-Superchain ecosystem portal \r\n-Human-readable structured data presentation\r\n-AI-Powered\r\n  - Automatically classifies and labels transactions\r\n  - Aggregation and visualization of data\r\n  - Smart Contract Analysis\r\n  - Intelligent search and filtering (with natural language)\r\n  -Code reader/Code Search/Similar Search\r\n\r\n  \r\nFor example, L2scan for other chains already launched:\r\n - Home: https://linea.l2scan.co/\r\n - Txns List: https://linea.l2scan.co/txs\r\n - Blocks List: https://linea.l2scan.co/blocks\r\n - Batches List: https://linea.l2scan.co/batches\r\n - Bridge Info: https://linea.l2scan.co/bridge\r\n - Top Accounts: https://linea.l2scan.co/top-accounts\r\n - Token ERC-20: https://linea.l2scan.co/tokens\r\n - Token ERC-721: https://linea.l2scan.co/tokens-nft\r\n - Token ERC-1155: https://linea.l2scan.co/tokens-nft1155\r\n - Charts & Status: https://linea.l2scan.co/charts\r\n - Dev Tools: https://linea.l2scan.co/devtools\r\n - Dapps Ranking: https://linea.l2scan.co/dapps\r\n - Verify Contract: https://linea.l2scan.co/verifyContract\r\n - Account system with watch list(real-time notify), tag, etc. https://scroll.l2scan.co/account/watch-list\r\n\r\n**What we can offer:** \r\n--A unified multi-chain explorer for the superchain ecosystem providing seamless UX for the user. \r\n--An open-source version to support the opstack developers as a blockscout alternative ( with more popular programming choices which makes it easier to maintain) \r\n\r\n**What we need:** \r\n--A grant from OP Foundation to support the hosted version hosting cost  & open source initiative \r\n--Featuring our open-source version in the superchain dev docs as the recommended option \r\n--Introducing opstack developers to us so we can monetize and find a sustainable business model\r\n",

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph) https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph ðŸ‘ˆ\n\n![Image](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/gov-internal/assets/43515441/0c769250-1c69-4b95-a404-b02e26759844)\n\nThis project can pick up on the existing visualizer and make minor changes to visualize the voting badge distribution or add new features that make this a useful tool for visualizing badgeholder attestations and attestations at large. \n\n### Resources\n- [Badgeholder EAS schema](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b), \n  - I deployed a version of it on Goerli for experimentation [here](https://optimism-goerli-bedrock.easscan.org/schema/view/0x59631c889e2c1f9befae214d3aecf7e865d987cee5ff8c29ddbaa0b50010a34b)\n- [RetroPGF round 3 voting badge distribution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-voting-badge-distribution/6557) \n- [RetroPGF round 2 voting badge distribution](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-2/#)\n- [Get nerdsniped on attestations ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/intro/)\n\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Contact**: Jonas (gh: @JSeiferth, TG/Discord: @jonassft)\n\n## Possible Features\n- **Basic**: Make changes to [coolgraph](https://github.com/smartcontracts/coolgraph) to display [badgeholder attestations](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b) and host it to be available to users. \n  - If the `refferedMethod` is \"badgeholderChoice\", the source should be the `referredBy` address and the target the attestation recipient\n  - if the `refferedMethod` is not badgeholderChoice, the source should be the `refferedMethod`(e.g. Foundation Choice, Past Badgeholder, Token House Elected or RetroPGF Recipient)\n- **Extended**: Display how voting badges were distributed over multiple rounds (round 2 & round 3 + future rounds)\n- **Extended**: Allow to discover the path of a specific voting badge - e.g. I can see how a specific badgeholder attained a voting badge and the relevant social graph \n- **Extended**: Display the [Optimist NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/optimist-nft) associated with each address\n-  **SuperFeature**: Allow for the visualization of any attestation by enabling users to input any EAS Schema\n- **SuperFeatureExtended**: Allow for the visualization of any attestation schema by enabling users to input any EAS schema and select arbitrary data fields to be visualized. \n\n## Impact\n- This can help drive understanding in the Citizens' House of how badgeholders are selected\n- This drives understanding of Optimism's identity layer \n- This could be the basis of a visual attestation explorer, a useful tool for users to interact with Optimism's identity layer\n\n",

In round 3, weâ€™re introducing Lists as a more powerful tool to facilitate that sharing of context, and enable badgeholders to easily leverage each other's proposed votes. \n\nThe [RetroPGF Voting application](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/104) will allow badgeholders to discover, view and interact with Lists (see screenshot of designs below). This mission will enable badgeholders to create the Lists that are surfaced in the RetroPGF Voting application. \n\n<details><summary>How Lists are presented to users</summary>\n<p>\n\n![259787144-77d40359-e219-4a4d-800d-874186661167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/assets/1016190/df0e7d8f-05be-40c7-b6f1-c673e61cf907)\n\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\nCompleting this Mission requires:\n* Outlining your proposed solution to allow badgeholders to create Lists\n* Building a frontend that enables badgeholders to create Lists by leveraging EAS for onchain attestations and posting metadata on IPFS. The frontend should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality.\n* Hosting and managing the application infrastructure while RetroPGF 3 is ongoing. \n\n**Core functionality of the application**\nEnable badgeholders to create Lists, the following steps are core to this user journey:\n- Input relevant metadata of a List (Name, description, impact evaluation description, impact evaluation link)\n- Filling in the contents of a List by choosing projects and inputting how much OP each project should receive\n- Posting the List onchain via EAS and associated metadata \n- View created Lists\n\nRelevant checks will need to applied to the creation of Lists, such as char limits and other limitations (e.g. the OP allocated among projects can't exceed the total round OP allocation.)\n\n**Technical Architecture and implementation**\n* **Query project data**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is used to query existing onchain information relating to entities and their RetroPGF 3 application (e.g. projects). This will be relevant to display project names and profile pictures, as well as referencing projects in List attestations. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted. \n* **Posting Lists**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is used to post the contents of a List onchain and reference the relevant metadata. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted.\n* The application should be live and usable by **Oct 14th 2023**, you will host the application yourself and maintain it until March 2024.\n* Everything that you build should be open-source under MIT license and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. \n\nYou can find the EAS & Metadata schema for Lists [here](https://gist.github.com/JSeiferth/fe8bf39c450be8772a9d93b7fc9a0702) \n\n### **What milestones will help the Collective track progress towards completion of this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\n1.

A good voting experience is core to supporting the work of badgeholders and ensuring an accurate RetroPGF process.Â Â \n\nRound 2 of RetroPGF put a high burden on the voting experience of badgeholders, requiring them to do a lot of manual work spreadsheets and forms.Â  This friction limited the overall accuracy of the RetroPGF round.  \n\nRound 3 of RetroPGF is set to[ build on the learnings of round 2](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/7v1DehEY3dpRcYFhqWrVNc9Qj94H2L976LKlWH1FX-8) and provide a richer and more intuitive experience for browsing projects and submitting votes.   \n\nBy doing so, this mission will contribute to a more accurate evaluation of projects and contribute to the overall success of RetroPGF 3.Â \n\n### **What is required to execute this Foundation Mission (RFP)?**\n\nCompleting this mission requires:\n1. Building a frontend that powers the discovery of projects and voting by badgeholders in RetroPGF round 3. The frontend will be based on existing designs and user stories and will utilize the Ethereum Attestation Service, and a combination of onchain and offchain (storage bucket, IPFS, etc.) sources to read data. The frontend should be fully open-source and should allow for future iterations of the functionality. The Foundation will provide product designs; this RFP primarily requires implementation. \n2. Hosting and managing the application infrastructure, including backend infrastructure needed to capture and store badgeholder votes.\n\n**Core functionality of the discovery & voting application**:\n\n* **Discover Projects**: The application will enable users to explore all nominated projects, including search, filtering and sorting functionality.\n* **Viewing a Project's Profile**: Users will be able to discover the profile of a specific project, populated with details provided by the project's team. The information will include general information about the project (name, creator, profile picture, social media links, etc.) and specific information relevant to RetroPGFâ€™s goal of aligning impact and profit (description of contributions, links to contributions, impact description, funding history, etc.).Â \n* **Discovering and voting on Lists**: A standout new feature of round 3 will be 'Lists', a new tool for badgeholders to share their votes with others. Users will be able to discover, search, filter and sort Lists. By selecting a List, a user will find general information about the list (name, creator, description, impact evaluation description) and the votes on a number of projects included in a list. Badgeholders will be able to either directly import the votes of the list into their ballot, or edit the votes in a list based on their preferences, before adding them to their ballot.Â \n* **Allocating and submitting votes**: Badgeholders will be able to allocate and submit votes. Badgeholders are voting on individual project profiles or via a list (see above). All votes are aggregated in a badgeholders ballot, where badgeholders are able to see an overview of their votes, make changes to individual votes and submit their ballot.Â \n\n**Technical Architecture and implementation**:\n\n* **Query project data**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is used to query existing onchain information relating to entities, their RetroPGF 3 application, and social verifications. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted.Â \n  * An entity represents individuals or organizations\n  * An application represents an entityâ€™s application for RetroPGF and maps 1:1 to an entity.Â \n  * A social verification represents an attestation made by OptimismFND that indiciates an entity is the owner of a specific Twitter or GitHub account\n* **Query project lists**: Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is leveraged to query existing onchain information relating to project lists. Relevant schema information and indexer will be provided once the proposal has been accepted.\n* **Create a voting backend**: Backend infrastructure is required to capture and store votes, badgeholder votes will be private and stored on a backend server hosted by yourself. Minor features in the application may require additional backend support.Â \n* You will host the application yourself and maintain it until March 2024.

    "body": "**What is an Ecosystem Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nAn Ecosystem Project Idea is an idea for a project that someone could build within the Optimism ecosystem. As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, users need to utilize the SDK or other low-level mechanisms to replay L1 => L2 or L2 => L1 transactions that ran out of gas. This can be complex for average users. A good tool would provide an interactive user interface for replaying transactions. This tool aims to simplify this process and make it more accessible.\r\n\r\n## Potential Features\r\n- **Query and Display Failed Transactions**: The tool would provide functionality to query both L1 and L2 chains using a user's public address to find transactions that have failed due to running out of gas. Should also be able to support searching by a specific transaction hash.\r\n- **Customize Gas Limit**: The user interface would allow users to specify a higher gas limit for replaying the failed transaction.\r\n- **Safe Replaying**: Before replaying, the tool should provide a cost estimation for the transaction and ask for user confirmation, this makes sure that the custom gas limit is going to be high enough.\r\n- **Tutorial and Help**: The tool would include a brief tutorial or walkthrough on how to use it, along with tooltips or help text to guide users.\r\n- **Real-time Updates**: The tool would offer real-time updates on the status of the transaction once replayed.\r\n- **Transaction History**: It should have the functionality to keep a history of all replayed transactions for a given address.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- **Increased Usability**: This tool will drastically improve the experience for users who face gas issues during transactions between L1 and L2.\r\n- **Accessibility**: It will make L2 interactions more accessible for non-technical users by removing the need to use the SDK for these transactions.\r\n- **Reduced Transaction Failures**: The tool will help to reduce the number of failed transactions on the network, leading to improved overall network health.\r\n- **Better User Experience**: By giving users control over their gas limits, it provides a more personalized and user-friendly interaction with L2.\r\n- **Educational**: This tool can serve as an educational resource for users to better understand gas costs and transaction dynamics in L2.\r\n",

In order to provide insights and better understanding of the state and performance of the L2 network, the L2 Network Health Dashboard will offer a range of crucial statistics in a visual, easy-to-understand format. As an important part of the ecosystem, the ability to monitor the health and performance of the L2 network will allow developers, users, and operators to make informed decisions and adjustments. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- The dashboard should be built using Grafana for real-time monitoring and interaction.\r\n- The dashboard should be fully open source.\r\n- The dashboard should have instructions on how to populate the dashboard.\r\n- The dashboard should track transaction latency and offer insights into the average, peak, and minimum transaction times.\r\n- The dashboard should keep track of the costs associated with specific actions on the network.\r\n- The dashboard should track the speed of block production and highlight any significant deviations.\r\n- The dashboard should be able to track reorganizations on the network.\r\n- The dashboard should be able to track the time taken for a block to be produced and sent to L1.\r\n- The dashboard should track block finalization times.\r\n- Flexibility for adding additional metrics or data points as they become relevant or necessary.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- The dashboard will provide critical insights into the performance of the L2 network, allowing for informed decision making.\r\n- The data collected and displayed could help identify any bottlenecks or areas of inefficiency on the network.\r\n- By making this information easily accessible, the dashboard could encourage the growth and development of the network by providing developers with the information they need to optimize their applications and services.\r\n- Having this kind of transparency could increase trust and confidence in the network. Users and developers alike will have a clearer understanding of how the network operates and performs under various conditions.\r\n",

    "body": "**What is an Ecosystem Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nAn Ecosystem Project Idea is an idea for a project that someone could build within the Optimism ecosystem. As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAs OP Mainnet and other L2 solutions gain traction, it becomes increasingly important to monitor and understand the resource consumption on these chains. Currently, it's challenging to get a clear picture of resource usage across gas, storage, and calldata. This project aims to create a comprehensive L2 resource usage monitoring tool that visualizes these aspects in real time and offers insights into usage patterns on OP Mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Potential Features\r\n\r\n- **Real-time visualization:** Display the use of resources such as gas, calldata, and storage in real-time.\r\n- **In-depth resource analysis:** Show detailed statistics of resource usage per transaction and the storage occupied by each contract.\r\n- **Filters:** Allow users to filter the displayed data based on various parameters, including time, type of transaction, contract, and more.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- **Valuable insights for developers:** This tool will provide in-depth resource usage insights, helping developers optimize their dapps for L2.\r\n- **Contribute to network health and optimization:** Understanding resource usage patterns can help in taking steps to further optimize the OP Mainnet network.\r\n- **Promote efficient resource usage:** By highlighting resource usage, this tool will encourage better coding practices and more efficient usage of network resources, contributing to a more scalable and sustainable network.\r\n",

Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis project aims to leverage the OP Stack chains, without a Sequencer, to index data. In particular, these chains, dubbed \"Indexing Chains,\" can capture various L1 data, such as gas burn information. By doing this, we can potentially replace the Ultra Sound Money website backend with an OP Stack chain Rollup. To do this, you would need to modify the OP Stack chain to constantly keep track of the L1 gas burn and store that information in an L2 smart contract.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Implement an Indexing Chain to track L1 gas burn.\r\n- Store the L1 gas burn in an L2 smart contract.\r\n- Replace the Ultra Sound Money website backend with the newly created Indexing Chain.\r\n- Query the L1 gas burn from the L2 smart contract via the USM website.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It offers a novel and efficient way to index L1 data.\r\n- Enhances the robustness and performance of the Ultra Sound Money website backend.\r\n- Showcases the versatility of the OP Stack chains for tasks beyond Sequencer-based operations.\r\n",

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nDevelop a latency testing tool for the OP Mainnet to track the dynamism of transaction latency. This tool would shed light on any issues impacting transaction inclusion times. If latency spikes, there might be network issues. Would be great to make as an open source tool that could also be provided as a public dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Facilitate configuration of routes (RPCs).\r\n- Enable the sending of various types of transactions at different intervals.\r\n- Record response times for each transaction.\r\n- Display a graph showcasing the correlation between transaction send times and response times.\r\n- Allow configuration of multiple RPCs and highlight differences in latency between them.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Provides invaluable data on the performance of OP Mainnet.\r\n- Assists in identifying and addressing latency issues.\r\n- Helps users and developers understand the implications of using different RPCs.\r\n",

    "body": "**What is an Ecosystem Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nAn Ecosystem Project Idea is an idea for a project that someone could build within the Optimism ecosystem. As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOriginally, Optimism considered introducing an attestation-based challenger module as a pathway towards decentralization. Though focus has shifted towards fault proofs, the attestation-based module remains a fascinating and worthwhile concept. Instead of a multisig, this module would utilize a smart contract that verifies EIP-712 signatures. Any participant could call the smart contract with an array of signatures and a proposed output hash for a given L2 block number. If a threshold of signatures approves that output hash for that block numberâ€” and if the existing proposed output hash in the L2OutputOracle contract differs from the signed-off proposalâ€”then the original proposed output hash is discarded.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Develop a slim server with a simple API route such as `/signature/block/N` that returns a signature over the correct proposal hash for block N.\r\n- Design the API to be callable by anyone.\r\n- If an incorrect proposal on L1 is detected, the API would be called on various known machines to obtain a threshold of signatures.\r\n- Incorporate a smart contract that accepts a proposed output hash for an L2 block number and a threshold of signatures.\r\n- If the threshold is met, and the proposed hash differs from the existing one in the L2OutputOracle, the existing proposal is removed.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Offer a novel approach towards securing the integrity of L2 block proposals.\r\n- Contribute to the broader ecosystem's understanding of decentralization mechanisms.\r\n- Help test the potential effectiveness of attestation-based challenger modules in a blockchain context.\r\n- Better than multisigs, easier than fault proofs.\r\n",

    "body": "**What is an Mad Science Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nA Mad Science Project Idea is an idea for a project within the Optimism ecosystem that may not have clear value but is generally cool as heck. Mad Science Project Ideas make great hackathon projects and tend to be a great way to explore Optimism, OP Mainnet, and the OP Stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nL2Geth was deprecated in favor of Bedrock last month. L2Geth, our legacy system, has two main parts: the Data Transport Layer (DTL) responsible for indexing data from Ethereum, and L2Geth itself, built on an older version of Geth. It would be interesting to have a new version of L2Geth that is based on the latest stable version of Geth. This might make syncing legacy OP Mainnet nodes faster and more reliable. You can continue to use the DTL or build your own consensus/execution client splitâ€”similar to how the OP Stack operates post-Bedrock.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Use of the latest stable release of Geth.\r\n- Option to use the current DTL or develop a custom consensus client.\r\n- Focus on L1 syncing, no need for Sequencer logic.\r\n- No need for p2p logic.\r\n- Rapid and efficient syncing of the legacy system, optimizing storage space.\r\n- Should be able to correctly sync the legacy system, can compare to old legacy nodes.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Speeding up the sync process for anyone needing to access legacy data.\r\n- Increasing the reliability of legacy nodes for those who keep them for archival purposes.\r\n",

    "body": "**What is an Ecosystem Project Idea?**\r\n\r\nAn Ecosystem Project Idea is an idea for a project that someone could build within the Optimism ecosystem. As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nRetroPGF Lists, being introduced in RetroPGF Round 3, are a versatile format that allows users to share their impact assessments of various projects. These lists contain a set of projects, each associated with an impact evaluation that might include, for example, a proposal of how much OP each project should receive based on their impact and profit. Additionally, each list should feature a title, a creator, and a description that outlines the methodology used for impact evaluation. A simple, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing interface for creating, editing, and sharing these lists is sought.\r\n\r\nSee below for an example of what a list might look like, visually\r\n\r\n<img width=\"261\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-26 at 8 21 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/assets/14298799/983e256a-1302-41b8-8284-85632fd4ebb4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Try using the AttestationStation/EAS contracts to host the data behind each List.\r\n- A clean and intuitive design that allows for the effortless creation of lists, including adding project names, assigning impact evaluations, and defining evaluation methodologies.\r\n- Editing capabilities for updating or fine-tuning the lists after their initial creation.\r\n- An aesthetic presentation of lists, designed to present information clearly and effectively to viewers.\r\n- Support for various curation methods, such as single-owner lists, multi-owner lists, or perhaps even voter-based lists.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It could simplify the process of creating and managing RetroPGF Lists, encouraging wider participation in impact evaluation.\r\n- By improving the visual presentation of these lists, the interface could aid in effectively communicating the evaluations to the broader community.\r\n- The support for various curation methods could open up new collaborative possibilities in the impact evaluation process.\r\n",

The interface should allow users to efficiently configure all the required files necessary for the deployment, as well as handle the smart contract deployment. One potential source of inspiration for this project is the Arbitrum Orbit Deployment user interface. After successful deployment, the interface should provide users with the configuration files and instruct them on how to run `op-node` and `op-geth` components using these files.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- A simple yet comprehensive setup process that enables users to configure all the necessary files for the deployment.\r\n- An integrated deployment mechanism that deploys the smart contracts on behalf of the users.\r\n- Post-deployment, the interface should provide an option to download the configuration files.\r\n- Clear instructions and guides on how to operate `op-node` and `op-geth` with the provided configuration files.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n\r\n- It can significantly streamline the process of spinning up an OP Stack based blockchain, making it accessible to a wider range of users.\r\n- By simplifying the configuration and deployment process, it may encourage more experimentation and development on the OP Stack.\r\n- It can enhance the user experience by providing guidance and clarity post-deployment, contributing to a smoother onboarding process.\r\n",

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOptimism-related resources are dispersed across a range of locations such as the Community Hub, the OP Stack documentation, the Optimism Twitter account, and the Optimism Governance Forum. The fragmentation makes it challenging for individuals to find relevant information, especially data about grants as the programs are frequently updated. To mitigate this issue, we suggest developing a user-friendly website that consolidates these resources and guides users to pertinent details efficiently.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- Easy navigation to guide users across available resources seamlessly.\r\n- Detailed descriptions of crucial elements such as how to apply for specific grants, recent changes in policies, upcoming events, and more.\r\n- A feature to help users establish connections with other projects and members of the Optimism community.\r\n- Ensure the website is regularly updated to reflect the most recent information and developments.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- Enhance the user experience by facilitating easier navigation through the Optimism ecosystem.\r\n- Aid individuals and projects in securing grants, promoting good work within the community.\r\n- Encourage more individuals to join the Optimism community by providing them with a centralized source of necessary information.\r\n",

As opposed to an Ecosystem Concept or an Ecosystem Idea, an Ecosystem Project is generally more fleshed out and corresponds to a relatively clear product to be built. \n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe RetroPGF grant process has changed for Round 3, now requiring teams to self-nominate. This shift could potentially leave out projects that are not aware of the process or the opportunity. To bridge this gap, we propose the creation of a public nomination form that anyone can fill out to nominate projects. The results of this form can be made available on a public read-only spreadsheet. This would allow teams to review community nominations and reach out to promising projects that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nNote: The RetroPGF sign-up itself is being build by the OP Labs EcoPod team and will go live in the coming months. This Project Idea's sole focus is a form for the community to suggest projects that should sign-up\n\n**OP Labs or Optimism Foundation Contact**: Jonas (gh: @JSeiferth, TG/Discord: @jonassft)\n\n## Possible Features\n\n- The form should be easy to fill out and provide clear instructions to guide nominators.\n- It should include specific fields designed to capture as much relevant information about the nominated project as possible.\n- The results of the form submissions should be automatically populated to a public read-only spreadsheet.\n- To prevent the influx of spammy entries, consider implementing basic form validation and moderation features.\n\n## Impact\n\n- It can help identify projects that might not be aware of RetroPGF and provide them with the opportunity to participate.\n- The publicly available spreadsheet of nominations can serve as a valuable resource for teams, giving them the ability to review and reach out to nominated projects.\n- This process could increase the pool of eligible projects for RetroPGF, resulting in a more diverse and inclusive grant process.\n",

In certain cases, developers might find the free tiers insufficient for their needs, leading to the necessity of purchasing premium packages. A potential solution to this issue can be the development of a high-quality RPC proxy that developers can host themselves. The key objective is to make the proxy straightforward and easy-to-configure so that it is accessible to developers at different levels of experience.\r\n\r\n## Possible Features\r\n\r\n- It should be easy to set up, configure, and integrate with existing systems.\r\n- The proxy should be capable of intelligently managing and routing requests to different providers based on their rate limits and the current request load.\r\n- It should be resilient and fault-tolerant, with the ability to failover to different providers in the event of an outage or if rate limits are exceeded.\r\n- The proxy should provide comprehensive logging and monitoring features to help developers understand the request load, rate limit usage, and the performance of different providers.\r\n- It should be able to work around the tier limits so that users are spending as little money as possible by taking advantage of existing free tiers.\r\n- Maybe some sort of UI for managing the proxy.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- It could potentially save developers considerable time, effort, and money by removing the need to manage interactions with different RPC providers and their respective limits.\r\n- By providing a robust and fault-tolerant solution, it can increase the reliability of applications that rely on RPCs.\r\n- The enhanced logging and monitoring can provide valuable insights into the performance and usage of different RPC providers, which can inform optimization efforts and reduce costs.\r\n",
